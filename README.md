# Human Contexts & Ethics Materials
Repository for sharing materials created by Human Contexts & Ethics (HCE) team under the Data Science Undergraduate Studies department at the University of California, Berkeley.

## About
Developed for Stage I of the Mozilla Responsibile Computer Science Challenge grant, the folders in this repository contain Jupyter notebooks and other materials for curriculum packages developed by the HCE team. Each centered around a case study, these packages integrate ethical contexts and discussions into technical coursework for UC Berkeley's upper-division data science courses. Our work highlights the inextricability of ethics from the practice of data science and encourages interdisciplinary critical thinking in order to better understand the impacts of sociotechnical work.

For more information, explore the directories for each curriculum package or visit the HCE curriculum package homepage [here](https://data.berkeley.edu/hce-curriculum-packages). If you have any questions, feel free to email us at <hce@berkeley.edu>!
