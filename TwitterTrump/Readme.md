# Trumps Tweets Curriculum Package
Developed by the Human Contexts & Ethics (HCE) team within the Data Science Education Program at the University of California, Berkeley. 

## About
Funded by the Mozilla Responsible Computer Science Challenge grant, this curriculum package integrates an ethical case study into UC Berkeley's core upper-division data science course, Data 100 (Principles & Techniques of Data Science). The official website for this project, can be found [here](https://data.berkeley.edu/hce-curriculum-package-meaning-speech).

Twitter has been a popular platform attracting celebrities, political and thought leaders and the common man to broadcast short messages to a wide audience. Donald Trump was an active user of the platform, using it to share his opinions, perform policy and influence the lives in people in the US and globally. Our dataset for this package contains several tweets by Donald Trump, and other information such as tweet time, tweet device and more. Using this information and textual analysis, we can come up with interesting insights into Trump's sentiment towards various topics, explore patterns about how he spread news and more.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand how technical data science tools can be applied to real world problems, how they can be used to investigate and expand one's understanding in this
case, of politics and public communication. <br>
- Know what sentiment analysis is, how to do sentiment analysis, and understand its use in a social media context.<br>
- Recognize that the sentiment of a word is context-dependent and consider how this affects the sentiment score that a word is given. <br>
- Understand the significance of different aggregation and abstraction processes used in creating a sentiment score and their relationship to the meaning and tone of text. <br>
