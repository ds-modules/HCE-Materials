# Cook County Curriculum Package
Developed by the Human Contexts & Ethics (HCE) team within the Data Science Education Program at the University of California, Berkeley. 

## About
Funded by the Mozilla Responsible Computer Science Challenge grant, this curriculum package integrates an ethical case study into UC Berkeley's core upper-division data science course, Data 100 (Principles & Techniques of Data Science). The official website for this project, although still a work-in-progress, can be found [here](https://data.berkeley.edu/hce-curriculum-package-value-home).

Previously, Homeworks 5 and 6 in the course's [Spring 2020](http://www.ds100.org/sp20/syllabus/) offering introduced students to linear regression by building a housing price prediction model. These homeworks utilized a dataset of housing characteristics and values in Ames, Iowa. The HCE team, however, felt that using a similar dataset from the Cook County Assessor's Office - which assesses property values to determine property taxes in Chicago - would encourage a more explicit examination of data science's embeddedness in social and historical contexts. With this dataset, the two edited Jupyter notebooks in this package grapple with concepts of bias, expertise, fairness, and transparency to resituate the role of technology in equitable government practices.

A slide deck presentation that further outlines the learning objectives and goals of this curriculum package can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oO8yATyGsaC89DblgNRvXBbA3rdcAqflp67jJ5b0oR0/edit?usp=sharing).

## Additional Materials
